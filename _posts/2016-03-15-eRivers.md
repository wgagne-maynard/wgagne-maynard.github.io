# **eRivers**

This is a project that started as a class assignment for UW eScience's [Software Enginnering for Data Scientists](http://uwseds.github.io) and is currently under development.

The purpose of this toolkit is to provide aquatic researchers with a reproducable way of cleaning, visualizing and analyzing high-resolution chemical data from both spatial and temporal sensors.  More and more environmental scientists are adopting these high-resolution sensors that can sample at rates up to 1 sample / second, but questions remain as to the ability to clean and analyze this data.  With this tool, we hope to provide a method for reproducable data cleaning and analysis as well as providing a platform for reserachers to view their data spatially and combine it with the wealth of spatial resources availble in Google Earth Engine.
