	<h1> <img src="/images/ugg.png" alt="Me", height="10%", width="10%", align="left", style="PADDING-RIGHT: 10px"> Hi there. I'm Will Gagne-Maynard</h1>
	<p> I'm a current graduate student in the School of Oceanography at the University of Washington and I do double duty as a <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/education/phd/igert-data-science-phd-program/">Data Science IGERT</a> fellow.  
	My research focuses broadly on carbon dynamics in large rivers. Currently, I do my fieldwork on the lower Amazon River.
	
	In different lives, I've worked on topics ranging from nutrient loading in eutrophic estuaries to correlating stream discharge with in-situ seismic monitors.  All of this work has been driven by a desire to take messy, environmental data and distill it into meaningful and actionable results</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	Since starting school at UW, I've had the opportunity to expand my background in the areas of software engineering, data visualization and statistics and am now exploring opportunities to use these skills on read-world data.

	<p>In my free time I like to <a href="/projects">make things</a>, explore the mountains and play frisbee. </p>
