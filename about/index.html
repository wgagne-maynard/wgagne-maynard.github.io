	<h1> <img src="/images/ugg.png" alt="Me", height="10%", width="10%", align="left", style="PADDING-RIGHT: 10px"> Hi there. I'm Will Gagne-Maynard</h1>
	<p> I'm a data enthusiast located in Seattle, WA.  Currently employed at <a href="www.tinypulse.com">TINYpulse</a>.  Prior to this, I worked in public health mapping and studied at the School of Oceanography at the University of Washington where I did double duty as a <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/education/phd/igert-data-science-phd-program/">Data Science IGERT</a> fellow.  
	My research focused broadly on carbon dynamics in large rivers and how to develop tools to look at these complex datasets.
	
	In different lives, I've worked on topics ranging from nutrient loading in eutrophic estuaries to correlating stream discharge with in-situ seismic monitors.  All of this work has been driven by a desire to take messy, environmental data and distill it into meaningful and actionable results</p>
