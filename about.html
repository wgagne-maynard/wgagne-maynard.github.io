	<h1> <img src="/images/ugg.png" alt="Me", height="10%", width="10%", align="left", style="PADDING-RIGHT: 10px"> Hi there. I'm Will Gagne-Maynard</h1>
	<p> I'm a data enthusiast located in Seattle, WA.  I'm current working with the Geospatial Team at <a href="www.healthdata.org">the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a> to help develop and vet geospatial vaccine models on a 5x5km scale.  Prior to this, I was a graduate student at the School of Oceanography at the University of Washington where I did double duty as a <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/education/phd/igert-data-science-phd-program/">Data Science IGERT</a> fellow.  
	My research focused broadly on carbon dynamics in large rivers and how to develop tools to look at these complex datasets.
	</p>
	<p>
	In different lives, I've worked on topics ranging from nutrient loading in eutrophic estuaries to correlating stream discharge with in-situ seismic monitors.  All of this work has been driven by a desire to take messy, environmental data and distill it into meaningful and actionable results</p>
	</p>
	<p>
	Since starting school at UW, I've had the opportunity to expand my background in the areas of software engineering, data visualization and statistics and am now exploring opportunities to use these skills on read-world data.

	<p>In my free time I like to <a href="/projects">make things</a>, explore the mountains and play frisbee. </p>
