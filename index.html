	<p>   I'm a graduate student at UW straddling the worlds of Environmental Science, Data Science and Chemical Oceanography. I'm interested in developing tools that help researchers more efficiently(and reproducibly) analyze and visualize their data.  This site will showcase some of these tools as well as whatever tangential paths I find along the way. </p>
